This project is a simple compiler for a custom programming language, implemented in C. It uses Flex (lex.l) for lexical analysis and Bison (synt.y) for syntax analysis. The compiler includes a symbol table, intermediate code generation (quads), and outputs assembly code. The project demonstrates the main phases of compilation: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.
